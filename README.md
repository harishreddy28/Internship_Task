TASK 1 Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)

Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours

This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool

Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

Task 3 Prediction using Decision Tree
Algorithm
(Level - Intermediate)
● For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it
graphically.
● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
predict the right class accordingly.
